This script aims to check if the communication between the system and the Telegram bot is working correctly. It serves as a quick way to test if:

* The bot token is correct.
* The chat ID (identifier of the group or conversation) is configured properly.
* The system can send messages to Telegram using the API.

The script typically sends a simple test message (like "Test communication with the Telegram bot") to the configured group or chat. If the message appears on Telegram, it confirms that the basic bot setup is functioning.

This test is useful before integrating the bot with systems, ensuring that the message-sending step is working correctly.
